    <h2>Microsoft Access</h2>
    <p>In the fall of 2014 I was working as a special education teacher for a small NPS.  I found myself promoted to Director of Special Education, trading my classroom for an office.  Shortly after an emergency situation occurred and I needed to contact a parent quickly.  I found out there was no centralized data system.  I ended up having to find the phone number which was written on a post-it-note in the back of a folder.  I knew there had to be a better way.</p>
    <p>After discussing the need for a database with the managing director I was informed we had exactly zero budget for anything.  This prompted me to open Microsoft Access and start looking around.  After 6 months of trial and error, and a lot of time on both youtube and various bulletin boards, I produced my first system.  It was awful, but it worked making it way better than having nothing at all.</p>
    <p>The most surprising thing I learned from this was how much I enjoy database development!  I found myself constantly working to improve the system.  I’d observe a problem (such as the laborious process we had for creating employee training certificates), and follow that up with the question “I wonder if I could create a system for that?”  Soon the answer was always “Yes.”</p>
    <p>In 2017 I left that school for a much better position as the Associate Director of Special Education.  I found out that just like my previous school, they had no real system for tracking student data.  After mentioning to the director my experience with Access, he encouraged me to give it a try.  Building on what I had learned, I created a system that proved to be robust and solved many of the problems.  Report cards, which took a long time and were very prone to human error, were automated insuring students are only offered the courses they need that are tied to their home district.  Transcripts, which were previously updated by hand, were also automated, reducing human error and the time and effort the office had to spend on transcript maintenance.  Just as before, I found my development time to be the most fun and satisfying.  </p>
    <p>In August of 2020 I was asked to add several new features, but the overall build wouldn’t allow for it.  I decided to take everything I knew and create an entirely new system.  In spring of 2021, system 2 rolled out and has proven to surpass my hopes and expectations.  Knowing that our sister campus was without a system of their own, I developed the new system to seamlessly work for both campuses.  One small change to the back end tells the system which school is using the database.  This impacts everything from report cards to incident reports.</p>
    <p>Recently I was asked to create a similar system for one of our company’s other departments.  Development is ongoing with an expected launch of March 2022. </p>
